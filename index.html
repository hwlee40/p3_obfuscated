            With increased financial digitization, Korean banks are shutting down their brick and mortar stores around the country.Throughout the pandemic, the elderly have struggled to access basic items such as masks using digital tools. More recently, their inability to quickly claim leftover vaccines through an online system left them at a disadvantage compared to the younger, tech-savvy population.</span>
            <br><br>

            <span class="bodyparagraph">Digitization of South Korea’s service sector further isolates an already-vulnerable community: the elderly. The growth of contact-less tools and financial transactions have reduced accessibility for the elderly despite the government’s attempts to improve digital education and ownership of smart devices. For instance, the proportion of those in their 60s and 70s who rely on digital banking is significantly lower than the rest of the population. Correspondingly, the reduction in the number of physical bank branches and bank tellers has constrained the elderly community’s access to these services. The national government is concerned that the digital gap between generations is continuing to widen, affecting the elderly’s access to not only financial services but also health services or even basic goods.</span><br><br>
            
            <span class="bodyparagraph">The gap in digital literacy between the younger and older generations may worsen the socio-economic status of the country’s aging population. Currently, almost half of the elderly population in South Korea live in relative poverty (living on less than 50% of the disposable median income). This is a looming challenge for an aging society as the elderly are projected to constitute 20% of the country’s population by 2025. The pandemic also led to increased isolation of the elderly as they spend more time at home, creating hardships in maintaining employment or connecting with their communities. These economic hardships, coupled with prolonged isolation, suggest that existing social safety nets remain insufficient in caring for this vulnerable population.</span>

        <div class="articletitle">South Korea Cuts Human Interaction in Push to Build ‘Untact’ Society</div>
        <div class="articleauthor">Raphael Rashid</div>
        <div class="articledate">December 9, 2021</div>
        <div class="articlebody">
            For Seoul-based graduate Lee Su-bin, the transition to a new lifestyle during the pandemic was no big deal.
            <br><br>
            “At the university library, I would reserve my books online, which would then be sanitised in a book steriliser before being delivered to a locker for pick up,” the 25-year-old says.
            <br><br>
            “Untact has made many aspects of life so convenient.”
            <br><br>
            Introduced in 2020, “Untact” is a South Korean government policy that aims to spur economic growth by removing layers of human interaction from society. It gathered pace during the pandemic and is expanding rapidly across sectors from healthcare, to business and entertainment.
            <br><br>
            The push to create contactless services is designed increase productivity and cut bureaucracy but has also fuelled concerns over the potential social consequences.
            <br><br>
            Choi Jong-ryul, a sociology professor at Keimyung University, says while there are advantages to developing an untact society, it also threatens social solidarity and may end up isolating individuals.
            <br><br>
            “If more people lose the ‘feeling of contact’ due to lack of face-to-face interaction, society will encounter a fundamental crisis,” Choi says.
            <br><br>
            In everyday life, small changes brought about by untact are becoming increasingly noticeable.
            <br><br>
            Robots brew coffee and bring beverages to tables in cafes. A robotic arm batters fries and chicken to perfection. At Yongin Severance Hospital, Keemi – a 5G-powered disinfection robot – sprays hand sanitiser, checks body temperature, polices social distancing, and even tells people off for not wearing masks.
            <br><br>
            Unmanned or hybrid shops are flourishing. Mobile carrier LG Uplus recently opened several untact phone shops, where customers can compare models, sign contracts and receive the latest smartphones without ever having to deal with a real person.
            <br><br>
            Civil services too are getting untact facelifts. Seoul City plans to build a “metaverse” – a virtual space where users can interact with digital representations of people and objects – and avatars of public officials will resolve complaints. Several local governments have launched AI call bots to monitor the health of those self-isolating. For Covid-19 patients receiving home treatment, a government app also monitors health and gives video access to a doctor.
            <br><br>
            The world of K-pop has also stepped into the metaverse. Fans create avatars where they can “meet” their favourites like Blackpink in a virtual space and receive virtual autographs.
            <br><br>
            Untact in South Korea is more than a buzzword: it represents a potential economic engine for the country.
            <br><br>
            “Untact companies have shown greater growth effects than face-to-face companies in attracting investment and creating jobs,” South Korea’s small business and startups minister Kwon Chil-seung told the Guardian, noting that 12 out of 15 Korean unicorn companies - private firms valued at US$1bn (£750m) or more - use non-face-to-face methods in their primary business.
            <br><br>
            “South Korea has a very strong (communications) infrastructure in the country and many industries based on that infrastructure,” he says, adding that untact is part of a growing global trend that has accelerated in light of the pandemic.
            <br><br>
            His ministry is so serious about the policy that it is pumping 9tn won ($7.6bn) into an “untact growth fund” to find and support 1,200 untact startups by 2025.
            <br><br>
            Many have welcomed the shift. The Seoul Institute found that 80% of residents in the capital who had engaged in non-face-to-face activities said they would continue doing so after the pandemic subsided.
            <br><br>
            Sociologist Choi Jong-ryul says untact provided some advantages - including allowing anonymity through electronic devices, freeing people from the pressures of formality and reducing emotional labour associated with the service industry. The latter problem is particularly acute in South Korea, where customer service is highly valued, hierarchical structures persist, and abusive behaviour by those in positions of power, known as ‘gapjil’, is commonplace.
            <br><br>
            But concerns over feelings of loneliness and social fragmentation remain.
            <br><br>
            The country recently announced plans to invest almost 30bn won ($25.4m) to research a digital treatment platform for depression, a project kickstarted as a result of not having human contact due to the pandemic.
            <br><br>
            Loneliness among elderly people – an existing problem in South Korea only exacerbated by the pandemic - is also receiving the untact treatment.
            <br><br>
            SK Telecom’s AI Care service is among several being deployed across the country that allows seniors living alone to interact with an AI speaker by asking it to play music, have a simple conversation, perform quizzes, or even call for help in an emergency. The system has reportedly reduced loneliness among users, and even been credited with saving lives by the country’s president.
            <br><br>
            “These technologies are not replacing humans. It’s about coexisting with humans,” says SK Telecom spokesperson Irene Kim.
            <br><br>
            Lee Su-bin says while she was comfortable using untact technologies such as unmanned shops, she had concern for others who may “have trouble using them”.
            <br><br>
            “I had to help a grandfather at an automatic kiosk the other day to order his meal,” she says.
            <br><br>
            Kwon acknowledges challenges exist regarding those who might be left behind by the sudden digital transformation brought about by untact, and that his government needs to implement policies and regulations to “strike a balance.”
            <br><br>
            The long-term impact of untact on society remains unclear, but Prof Choi believes an untact future is inevitable to increase economic efficiency.
            <br><br>
            “The key is understanding the social and ethical implications of an untact society and finding ways to maintain social solidarity.”

        <div class="articletitle">The South Koreans Left Behind in a Contact-Free Society</div>
        <div class="articleauthor">Julie Yoonnyung Lee</div>
        <div class="articledate">August 5, 2020</div>
        <div class="articlebody">
            Like many people around the world, Lee Ye-rin has spent most of the last few months alone at home. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the 32-year-old office worker now works remotely from her apartment in Seoul; she avoids going to the gym by training at home and streams films on her TV rather than going to the cinema. She reads e-books instead of going to the library, which has been closed during the pandemic anyway. “I have rarely eaten out since the outbreak,” Lee says. “Instead, I order a variety of takeaway meals and even ice-cream for dessert on a delivery app. When I am fed up with that, I order ingredients from the grocery store and cook at home.”

            <br><br>
            This isolated way of life has become the ‘new normal’ for many since lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders were introduced. But for South Koreans, it’s been on its way since even before Covid-19 hit. In fact, there’s even a word for it.
            <br><br>
            ‘Untact’ – a combination of the prefix ‘un’ and the word ‘contact’ – has been floating around in marketing circles since 2017. It describes doing things without direct contact with others, such as using self-service kiosks, shopping online or making contactless payments. Some believe this is a natural progression in a modern society like South Korea, which combines robotic baristas, virtual make-up studios and digital financial transactions with an ageing population and a shrinking labour force.

            <br><br>
            Since the Covid-19 outbreak, ‘untact’ has moved from being a buzzword to becoming a central government policy. President Moon Jae-in’s recently announced “New Deal” economic plan includes a pledge to “promote untact industries” such as remote health and senior care, virtual offices and e-commerce support for small businesses.
            <br><br>
            A recent local survey by job search engine Saramin showed that 71.6% of South Korean adults felt their ‘untact’ economic activities had increased as a direct result of the pandemic. Yet in what is considered to be one of the most technologically advanced countries, the rapid rise of a minimal-contact society has left a swathe of elderly people behind.
            <br><br>
            While South Korea has impressive high-speed internet infrastructure with an internet penetration rate of nearly 96%, according to a 2019 survey conducted by the National Information Society Agency (NIA) only 29.2% of people in their 60s and older said they could install and use mobile applications and only 22.7% said they used e-commerce. In fact, research from the University of Greenwich found that the most frequently used functions used by over-60s in South Korea were making phone calls and checking the time. Compare that to Korea’s 30-39-year-olds whose level of internet usage is at 100%, with those between 10 and 29 years of age at 99.9%.

            <br><br>
            The digital divide is a social issue faced by countries worldwide. While there’s no doubt that socio-economic factors limiting physical access to the technology are a barrier to many, there’s also the issue of helping people who do have access learn how to use it. The same NIA survey found that access to digital devices among the information-vulnerable class – which includes people with disabilities, the elderly and those on low-incomes - was 97.1%, confirming that most South Koreans have a computer or a smartphone.
            <br><br>
            That means the nation’s digital gap isn’t just between the have and have-nots, it’s between those who can use their devices and those who can’t. And when the pandemic hit, presenting a raft of challenges and digital coping mechanisms, the problem of that digital divide – and who could and could not thrive in an ‘untact’ society – was laid bare.
            <br><br>
            South Korea is broadly considered to have been successful in its fight against Covid-19 and technology has played a key role. An effective contact tracing system was put in place, digital maps were widely distributed to help people keep track of the spread of Covid-19 as well as provide information on the location of patients and those with whom they had been in contact. Some navigated the digital technology, which was introduced to make information more available to the public, much better than others.
            <br><br>
            One example: there was a "mask crisis" in the early phase of the epidemic. As massive crowds formed queues at shops, new mobile applications and websites sprang up listing real-time mask inventory from retailers. Young people were able to use this information to find masks easily, while many elderly people had to take their chances with their local pharmacies.

            <br><br>
            Chung Hyang-sook, 71, says she waited in a queue for over an hour to buy a mask but they were sold out once she reached the front, and she went home empty-handed. "I heard there are mask inventory apps, but it's difficult for older people to use. At our age, it's faster to just go to the store than to check the mobile apps,” she says.
            <br><br>
            Then there was the question of how to spend the long days of lockdown. Social distancing measures have greatly reduced face-to-face activities but this doesn’t seem to have had a particularly negative impact on younger digital natives. Some even think their new “untact” way of life is better than the old way.

            <br><br>
            Beon Gi-yeong, a graduate student in Seoul, has been enjoying online art exhibitions and virtual live concerts since the Covid-19 outbreak, and says the her access to the arts has actually improved. “Recently, there was a live-stream performance of Swan Lake at the [LG Arts Center] for two days. I've always wanted to see Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake performance, and I had a chance to see the superb performance for free. I also watched a YouTube recital by pianist Cho Sung-jin in April,” says Beon.
            <br><br>
            Many elderly people, however, are struggling as they adapt to lives isolated from their usual support systems. Most local senior citizen centres, where the elderly can socialise, are closed and according to a survey by Hankook Research, 97% of senior citizens in their 60s and older said they refrained from going out after the outbreak.
            <br><br>
            "I've been stuck at home alone for months,” says 79-year-old Choi Byung-wan, who lives alone in Seoul. Pre-coronavirus, he was a regular at his local senior centre but since early February he has stayed put. Choi is fearful of getting the virus and only ventures out when he absolutely has to get groceries or go to a hospital appointment.

            <br><br>
            While he has a smartphone, he isn’t able to navigate the new landscape of virtual activities keeping the younger generation occupied. To pass the time he watches television and clicks on links to YouTube videos that he is sent via Kakaotalk (the Korean version of WhatsApp) on his phone. “There isn’t much I can do so I just spend all day watching TV,” he says. “The welfare centre often calls me to say hello, and that is the only joy for me these days.”
            <br><br>
            The digital divide is not a new problem in South Korea, says Park Chang-ho, a professor of information sociology at Soongsil University in Seoul. “When buying train tickets at Seoul station for example, only the elderly line up at the ticket counter because they are not used to digital devices like ticket kiosks,” he says. “The problem has existed before, but coronavirus has highlighted the issue.”
            <br><br>
            It’s a problem of which the South Korean government is all too aware. Science and ICT Minister Choi Ki-young has acknowledged the need for an inclusive digital economy, warning that the digital divide “could widen the social gap even further”, particularly in the coronavirus era. There’s also the question of vital information getting to where it is needed. In a recent survey, 83% of participants predicted that the information gap would get worse in the post-coronavirus era, while 65% said that official information was not evenly delivered to everyone during the pandemic.

            <br><br>
            In the past, policy-makers have mostly focused on improving people’s access to digital devices. On this front, they have succeeded. But Park Chang-Ho also thinks that recent events have shifted public attitudes towards the importance of an inclusive digital landscape. “In the past, if the government talked about fostering a digital-friendly environment, some would push back and say ‘what do we do with senior citizens who are not familiar with digital?’,” he says. “But now it seems that many people have come to naturally accept the necessity of it in the social environment.”

            <br><br>
            There are plans to establish 1,000 digital education centres across the country as well as hire people to teach digital literacy skills. As elderly people are still being encouraged to stay at home, Choi says the government’s New Deal policy also aims to facilitate technology they can use by themselves, like a digital device that senses their blood pressure and pulse, to flag up if they need a check-up or home visit.
            <br><br>
            The pandemic has shown that any ‘untact’ future in South Korean will be about much more than online shopping. It will be about the equal distribution of information among all demographics, the ability to stay connected to health and social services, and the knowledge that ‘non-contact’ doesn’t mean leaving behind the vulnerable in society.

            <br><br>
            "The government has no choice but to pay attention to such issues now,” says Park. And if they get it right, it could give the rest of the world a glimpse into future societies everywhere.

            Jae-Yeol Tae recalls the time he broke into a cold sweat after noticing a long line behind him as struggled to order a hamburger on a local fast-food restaurant's self-order kiosk.
            <br><br>
            “I kept reading the instructions on the kiosk, but they were difficult to follow. I asked for help from an employee, but she flat-out rejected me and told me to use the machine,” Tae, 78, said. “But now that I’ve practiced how to use a kiosk many times, I have no problem ordering a burger or fries on my own.”

            <br><br>
            The South Korean senior is not the only one who has felt powerless and at the mercy of such self-serve digital kiosk machines. Adults ages 65 and older have enrolled in the senior digital education program at Seoul-based Seocho Joongang Senior Welfare Center to learn how to use the devices in this modern digital era.


            <br><br>
            Seocho District’s senior community center has been providing digital education classes and resources for willing seniors over the past two years. Since September 2019, more than 1,500 senior citizens have learned how to use digital machines and devices like self-serve kiosks through the program.

            <br><br>
            The educational kiosks at the welfare center provide various scenarios for the students to practice real-life simulations. The scenarios are divided into nine different themes, which range from purchasing tickets at movie theaters, airports and bus terminals to ordering food at fast-food restaurants and cafes.

            <br><br>
            “We’ve significantly expanded educational programs focused on maneuvering digital devices to help better the livelihood of senior citizens since the start of the pandemic,” Yu-rim Kang, 25, a social worker at the welfare center who guides seniors in more active digital use, told ABC News. “Elders often have a hard time in public places due to the sudden shift towards a more contact-free culture.”


            <br><br>
            After two years of enduring the pandemic, a large number of restaurants and stores have adopted self-service electronic kiosks as alternatives to keep personnel costs down while continuing to keep their businesses running. The size of the domestic kiosk market is expected to grow 5.7% annually by 2023, according to the report from Shinhan Investment Corporation.

            <br><br>
            Digital education for senior citizens has become a necessity as South Korea continues to accelerate the digitization of its public sectors in accordance with the nation’s pandemic regulations. Anyone who wants to enter any sort of public facility must check in using their personal QR code on their smartphones to provide proof of vaccination.

            <br><br>
            At the start of 2022, Seoul introduced the “cash-free bus” initiative designating 418 buses to only accept transportation cards or mobile tickets. The project offers passengers instant mobile tickets by scanning QR codes at bus stations, but it makes public transportation more complicated for less tech-savvy senior citizens who typically carry around cash only.

            <br><br>
            “I’d like to say if we senior citizens don’t want to fall way behind the rest of society, we need to be prepared for any future changes,” Hye-sook Park, a 74-year-old student who once had technophobia, told ABC News. “Don’t be afraid to try and learn new technologies.”


            <br><br>
            Seocho District’s senior community center is not the only one promoting digital education for older adults. In an effort to support digitally-isolated senior citizens and diversify accessibility to these programs, Seoul runs educational programs on various digital devices including smartphones, kiosks and even virtual reality sets.

            <br><br>
            The Seoul Metropolitan Government also recently announced that it will invest over $1.68 million to further expand education resources necessary for senior support.
